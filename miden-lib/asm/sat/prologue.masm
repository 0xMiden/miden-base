# PUBLIC INPUTS
# =================================================================================================

#! Processes the global inputs provided via the stack. This involves storing the global inputs at

#!
#! Stack: [BH, acct_id, IAH, NC]
#! Output: []
#!
#! - BH is the latest known block hash at the time of transaction execution.
#! - acct_id is the account id of the account that the transaction is being executed against.
#! - IAH is the initial account hash of the account that the transaction is being executed against.
#! - NC is the nullifier commitment of the transaction. This is a sequential hash of all
#!   (nullifier, script_root) pairs for the notes consumed in the transaction.

# BLOCK DATA

#!    account vault).
#! 3. Verify that all consumed notes are present in the note db.
#!
#! Errors:
#!  - If data provided by the advice provider does not match global inputs.
