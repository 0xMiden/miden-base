# Miden Transaction Benchmarking

Below we describe how to benchmark Miden transactions.

Benchmarks consist of two groups:
- Benchmarking the transaction execution.

  For each transaction, data is collected on the number of cycles required to complete:
  - Prologue
  - All notes processing
  - Each note execution
  - Transaction script processing
  - Epilogue:
    - Total number of cycles
    - Authentication procedure
    - After tx cycles were obtained (The number of cycles the epilogue took to execute after the number of transaction cycles were obtained)
  
  Results of this benchmark will be stored in the [`bin/bench-tx/bench-tx.json`](bench-tx.json) file.
- Benchmarking the transaction execution and proving.
  For each transaction in this group we measure how much time it takes to execute the transaction and to execute and prove the transaction. 

  This group uses the [Criterion.rs](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs) to collect the elapsed time. Results of this benchmark group are printed to the terminal and look like so:
  ```zsh
  Execute transaction/Execute transaction which consumes single P2ID note
                        time:   [7.2611 ms 7.2772 ms 7.2929 ms]
                        change: [−0.9131% −0.5837% −0.3058%] (p = 0.00 < 0.05)
                        Change within noise threshold.
  Execute transaction/Execute transaction which consumes two P2ID notes
                        time:   [8.8279 ms 8.8442 ms 8.8633 ms]
                        change: [−1.2256% −0.7611% −0.3355%] (p = 0.00 < 0.05)
                        Change within noise threshold.

  Execute and prove transaction/Execute and prove transaction which consumes single P2ID note
                        time:   [698.96 ms 703.92 ms 708.70 ms]
                        change: [−2.3061% −0.4274% +0.9653%] (p = 0.70 > 0.05)
                        No change in performance detected.
  Execute and prove transaction/Execute and prove transaction which consumes two P2ID notes
                        time:   [706.52 ms 710.91 ms 715.66 ms]
                        change: [−7.4641% −5.0278% −2.9437%] (p = 0.00 < 0.05)
                        Performance has improved.
  ```

## Running Benchmarks

You can run the benchmarks in two ways:

### Option 1: Using Make (from miden-base directory)

```bash
make bench-tx
```

This command will run both the cycle counting and the time counting benchmarks.

### Option 2: Running each benchmark individually (from miden-base directory)

```bash
# Run the cycle counting benchmarks
cargo run --bin bench-transaction --features concurrent

# Run the time counting benchmarks
cargo bench --bin bench-transaction --bench time_counting_benchmarks --features concurrent
```
