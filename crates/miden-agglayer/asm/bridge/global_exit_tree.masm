#! Verifies the validity of the CLAIM note proof against the Global Exit Tree.
#!
#! This procedure verifies that a claim proof is valid against the Global Exit Tree (GET).
#! Currently this is a stubbed implementation that always returns 1 (true).
#!
#! Inputs: [GER(8), is_from_l1, leaf_info, proof_ptr]
#! Outputs: [1] (currently always returns 1)
#!
#! Where:
#! - GER(8): Global Exit Tree root (8 elements, 2 words)
#! - is_from_l1: Flag indicating whether the claim is for L1->L2 transfer (1) or L2->L2 transfer (0)
#! - leaf_info: Field element encoding leaf indexes:
#!   - Upper 32 bits: rollup exit tree index (0 in case of L1->L2 transfer)
#!   - Lower 32 bits: bridge message index
#! - proof_ptr: Pointer to memory address where Merkle proof(s) are located
#!
#! Invocation: exec
pub proc verify_claim_proof
    # TODO: Implement actual Global Exit Tree proof verification
    # For now, drop all inputs and return 1 (valid)
