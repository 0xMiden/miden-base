# CONSTANTS
# ================================================================================================

#! The attachment scheme for NetworkAccountTarget attachments.
#! This is a valid u32 that can be compared against an extracted attachment scheme.
pub const NETWORK_ACCOUNT_TARGET_ATTACHMENT_SCHEME = 1

#! The attachment kind for NetworkAccountTarget attachments (Word = 1).
#! This is a valid u32 that can be compared against an extracted attachment kind.

# ERRORS
# ================================================================================================

#! Returns the account ID encoded in the attachment.
#!
#! The attachment is expected to have the following layout:
#! [0, exec_hint_tag, account_id_prefix, account_id_suffix]
#!
#! WARNING: This procedure does not validate that the returned account ID is well-formed.
#! The caller should validate the account ID if needed using `account_id::validate`.
#!
#! Inputs:  [NOTE_ATTACHMENT, NOTE_METADATA_HEADER]
#! Outputs: [account_id_prefix, account_id_suffix]
#!
#! Where:
#! - account_id_{prefix,suffix} are the prefix and suffix felts of an account ID.
#!
#! Panics if:
#! - the attachment scheme does not match NETWORK_ACCOUNT_TARGET_ATTACHMENT_SCHEME.
#!
#! Invocation: exec

#! Creates a new attachment of type NetworkAccountTarget with the following layout:
#! [0, exec_hint_tag, account_id_prefix, account_id_suffix]
#!
#! Inputs:  [account_id_prefix, account_id_suffix, exec_hint]

#! - account_id_{prefix,suffix} are the prefix and suffix felts of an account ID.
#! - exec_hint is the execution hint for the note.
#! - attachment_kind is the attachment kind (Word = 1) for use with `output_note::set_attachment`.
#! - attachment_scheme is the attachment scheme (1) for use with `output_note::set_attachment`.
