# Polygon Miden Intro

## Welcome to the Polygon Miden Documentation
Polygon Miden is a zk-optimized rollup with client-side proving. It is expected to launch a public testnet in Q3. 

Unlike most other rollups, Polygon Miden prioritizes zk-friendliness over EVM compatibility. It also uses a novel, actor-based state model to exploit the full power of a zk-centric design. These design choices allow Polygon Miden to extend Ethereumâ€™s feature set. These features allow developers to create applications currently difficult and impractical on EVM-like systems. 

Polygon Miden will be the first decentralised rollup that leverages execution proofs of concurrent, local transactions. Anyone can execute a transaction and create a STARK-proof for the network. Executing a transaction in Miden means changing the state of a single account. Execution and proving can happen concurrently and privately (locally) in Polygon Miden.

This documentation presents detailed guides on:

- Polygon Miden Architecture
- Polygon Miden Protocol
- Participating in the Polygon Miden Testnet

## Polygon Miden create a new design space secured by Ethereum
Our goal is to not only scale Ethereum but to extend it. Rollups - secured by Ethereum - can be new design spaces and even experimental. This is the place to innovate. The base layer, however, should stay conservative and only slowly evolve to ensure the required safety and stability. 

Like other rollups, we want to scale Ethereum and inherit its security. We want to provide a safe and decentralized environment for composable smart contracts. 

But there is more. Rollups allow the creation of new design spaces while retaining the collateral security of Ethereum. We aim to create a design space for new applications secured by Ethereum.
