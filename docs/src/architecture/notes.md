# Notes
Miden aims to achieve parallel transaction execution and privacy. The UTXO-model combined with client-side proofs provide those features. That means, in Miden exist notes as a way of transferring assets between and to interact with accounts. Notes can be consumed and produced asynchronously and privately.

The following pages describe the note object, related note concepts, and the lifecycle of a note.
