This section shows you how to get started with Miden by generating a new Miden account, requesting funds from a public faucet, and interacting with the Miden rollup using the Miden client. 

By the end of this tutorial, you will have:

- Configured the Miden client.
- Connected to a Miden node. 
- Created an account and requested funds from the faucet.
- Transferred assets between accounts by generating and consuming notes.

## Prerequisites

### Rust

Download from [the Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

### Miden node IP address

You will need access to a Miden node. The node processes transactions and creates blocks for the Miden rollup. 

Get the IP address of the running Miden node by contacting one of the Miden engineers. 

### Miden client

Install the [Miden client](https://docs.polygon.technology/miden/miden-client/install-and-run/).
